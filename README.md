# Vocal_separation_with_Demucs_and_Speaker_Conversion_with_RVC_and_SO-VITS-SVC4.0

This notebook demonstrates how to download audio from YouTube, separate it into vocals and background music using htdemucs, perform speaker conversion on the vocals using RVC and SO-VITS-SVC 4.0, and then integrate the converted vocals back with the background music. In this notebook, we focus only on the inference process.

Note: In the RVC notebook, please restart the runtime midway through the process to avoid numpy errors. Due to my limited knowledge, I am not aware of other solutions for this issue.
